Prometheus Flight Controller

The Promethus Flight Controller is an advanced board designed for avionics and telemetry in rocketry, featuring an STM32F446RCT6 for processing and executing a PID control algorithm. It integrates key sensors like the BMP390 for pressure readings and the BNO085 IC for sensor fusion of gyro, accelration and magnetomter data. The system includes a piezo buzzer and RGB LED for status indication, an RFM95W RF module for telemetry communication, the MAX-M10S-00B GNSS module for geolocating the rocket during flight, actuators for controlling servo motors and a data aquisition unit for data logging.  The board can also be powered b a 9V battery or a LiPo batttery.
